# HackPrinceton2022


MedicNow Is a project that was done in a Hackathon at Princeton University during the fall of 2023. Please note that the project isn't fully complete. 

The idea of MedicNow is that we utilize a logisitcal regression classifier to point out the false positives of diabetes and help people save money on tests.
